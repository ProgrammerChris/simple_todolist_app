# Simple "Todolist"-app

Simple todolist app made partly by following "Coding in flow"s tutorials on Youtube (Local DB save) and partially by myself.

### With widget functionality! (Main reason i built this. I wanted notes in a widget and NO ADDS!)

Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.chris.todolist)
